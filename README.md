## Folder structure:

- main.py : the top most file, where the code should start.
- printOutput.py: This will print output of the code on the console as well as in text file.
- filters.py: Data filtering based on different aspects should be merged here.

## Execution:

For windows:
in the console execute the command `python main.py`

For Linux/Mac:
in the console execute the command `python3 main.py`
